<h1>FaNT and the calculation of the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)</h1>
  
<p>FaNT supports speech detection and frequency weighting in the
calculation of the signal-to-noise ratio.  The motivation behind 
these features is explained below.

<p>As noted below by Daniel Ellis and George Doddington, there is
considerable ambiguity in the research literature about how SNR is
calculated.  To prevent such ambiguity, we recommend that researchers
using FaNT mention their use of FaNT (and what FaNT options were
used). FaNT was used to create the popular Aurora 2 (Hirsch and
Pearce, 2000) and Aurora 4 data sets.  Thus, many researchers are
already familiar with SNR levels calculated using FaNT.

<h2>Speech detection in FaNT</h2>

<p>FaNT performs speech detection using the ITU-T P.56 Speech
Voltmeter from the <a href="http://www.itu.int">ITU</a>
Software Tools Library (G.191 Annex A).
Section 9 of (Neto, 1999) explains the design and operation of the
Speech Voltmeter.  FaNT should not be used to lower the SNR
of speech that is already noisy, because the speech detection in the
Speech Voltmeter is not designed for noisy speech.  Also note that the
correct audio sampling rate must be specified to FaNT for the Speech
Voltmeter to operate reliably.

<h2>Frequency weighting in FaNT</h2>

<p>FaNT supports frequency weighting during SNR calculation using
G.712 frequency weighting or A-weighting.  It is also possible to use
no frequency weighting, but please read the discussion of frequency
weighting below by George Doddington.  (The ITU Software Tools Library
manual suggests bandlimiting the Speech Voltmeter's input signal to
300-3400 Hz for telephony band signals and 100-7000 Hz for wideband
signals.  FaNT does not follow this suggestion.  However, Simão Ferraz
De Campos Neto, the author of the Speech Voltmeter, told us by email
that he believes this suggestion is only meant to increase the
comparability of different measurements, and is not based on an
inherent limitation of the Speech Voltmeter algorithm.)

<h3>Why use speech detection in SNR calculation? (by Daniel P.W. Ellis)</h3>

<p><b>SNR</b> (Signal-to-noise ratio) is a standard measure of the amount 
of background noise present in a speech (or other) signal.  It is 
defined as the ratio of signal intensity to noise intensity, expressed 
in decibels, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>    SNR_dB = 20.log10(S_rms / N_rms)</PRE>
<P>
where S_rms is the root-mean square of the speech signal (without any 
noise present) i.e. sqrt(1/N*sum(s[n]^2)), and N_rms is the root-mean 
square level of the noise without speech.  This is equal to:
</P>
<PRE>    SNR_dB = 10.log10(S_e / N_e)</PRE>
<P>
where S_e is the total energy of the speech i.e. sum(s[n]^2) etc.  

<P> The difficulty of this measure comes from the highly nonuniform
nature of the speech.  Consider an utterance of 1 second duration; it
has a certain energy E.  We can construct a noise-corrupted version at
a given SNR by finding some noise sample (say white noise, or a
recording of ambience in a moving car) of the same duration, and
scaling its level to obtain the desired SNR according to the above
equations, then adding the two together.  </P> 

<P> If we then consider a second version of the speech example with 1
second of silence (zero-valued samples) added to make its total
duration 2 seconds, its total energy is unchanged.  However, to make a
2 second sample of the noise that has the same total energy as the 1
second example, we would need to reduce its amplitude by about 30% so
that sum(n[n]^2) is the same when twice as many values of n
are involved.  This is a real problem: the actual level of noise
added to achieve a given global SNR depends strongly on the amount of
padding added to (or, in general, silence present in) the speech example.
Much confusion has resulted from SNR levels quoted in papers that have
fallen foul of this ambiguity.  


<h2>Frequency weighting</h2>

<p>FaNT can apply a G.712 or A-weighting filter to the speech and
noise signals during SNR calcluation.  

<h3>Why use frequency weighting in SNR calculation? (by George Doddington)</h3>

<p>ASR [automatic speech recognition] degradation will be far greater
for white noise than for low frequency noise at the same SNR value [if
the SNR calculation does not use frequency weighting].  This is true
for human as well as ASR performance. 
 
<p>A common method for minimizing this variability is to weight the
signal and noise energy as a function of frequency.  There is a
standard "A weighting" to achieve this, which can be approximated
reasonably by measuring the energy in the first-order difference
signal.  Of course, without this frequency weighting, it becomes
possible to show really good noise robustness numbers -- just use a
noise signal with a lot of very low frequency energy!  But for the
scientifically inclined, frequency weighting is de rigueur.
